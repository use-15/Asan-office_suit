Development Considerations (Senior Dev Notes)

Architecture

· Core engine: Rust (for speed, memory safety) or C++ (for VBA compatibility)
· UI framework: WebView2 (Windows) + WebKitGTK (Linux) + WKWebView (macOS) – or Canvas/SVG-based rendering with Skia
· File format handling: Use LibreOffice’s document liberation libraries or Apache POI (Java) + PDFium (PDF) + MuPDF (OCR)
· Offline storage: SQLite for recent documents, user preferences, custom dictionaries
· Printing: OS-native print dialog with Cairo/Quartz rendering

Key Technical Challenges

1. DOCX rendering fidelity: Reverse-engineer Office Open XML (ECMA-376) – handle wacky edge cases (nested tables, floating objects, complex fields)
2. XLSX formula engine: Implement 450+ functions with circular reference detection, volatile functions, array evaluation
3. PPTX morph transition: Calculate interpolation between slide objects (position, color, size, rotation)
4. PDF editing: Incremental update (append new objects), preserve digital signatures, handle encrypted and linearized PDFs
5. OCR integration: Tesseract 5 (offline) with layout analysis, automatic language detection
6. Macros: VBA interpreter (or embed Lua/JavaScript for cross-platform)

Build & Distribution

· Desktop: Electron (slower but easier) or Tauri (Rust backend, smaller binary)
· Web version: Same codebase compiled to WASM (localStorage only)
· Installers: NSIS (Windows), pkg (macOS), .deb/.rpm (Linux)

Testing Strategy

· File compatibility: Microsoft Office binary test suite (1,000+ DOCX/XLSX/PPTX with complex features)
· Round-trip tests: Import → edit → export → compare with original (render diff)
· Performance: Open 200MB Excel file, render 100-slide PPTX, OCR 500-page PDF
· Memory leak detection: Valgrind/DrMemory for native code
